well basically...

this project is from appcoda.com

using a neat iOS 6 (only) feature called UICollectionView which is basically a grid layout for images (say). you can furthermore customize the grouping of items in the layout (called 'sections') and for each section have custom headers & footers.

UICollectionView (Apple) <=> GridLayout (Android)
